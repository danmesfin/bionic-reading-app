# Bionic Reading App

This is a web application that formats text using the Bionic Reading method. The app is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/danmesfin/bionic-reading-app.git
cd bionic-reading-app
npm install
```

Next, start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Features

The app provides the following features:

- Input validation to ensure that only valid text is formatted.
- Real-time formatting of input text using the Bionic Reading method.
- Responsive layout for optimal viewing on all devices.

## How It Works

To format text using the Bionic Reading method, the app uses a custom algorithm that strategically bolds parts of words to make text easier to process. The algorithm is implemented in the `formatText` function in the `FormattedText.js` component.
